# StrangerVision — YOLOv11s Stranger Things Character Detector

StrangerVision is a deep learning–based computer vision project that detects and classifies characters from the Stranger Things TV series using the YOLOv11s object detection model.

This project demonstrates end-to-end implementation of dataset preparation, model training, fine-tuning, and real-time inference for custom object detection.
